\paragraph Both data and data warehouses are widely used to store big data, but there are no interchangeable terms. A data lake is an immense set of raw data. A data warehouse is a repository of filtered and structured data that has already been processed for a specific purpose.

People often confuse these types of data storage, when in fact they are greater than their similarities. In fact, the only real similarity between the two is its maximum purpose, which is to store data.

The difference is important, because they are designed for the objectives and the results. While it is better for a company to have a data lake, to obtain more results in the opportunity of a data warehouse.
